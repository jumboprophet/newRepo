# This is my first file in github and I am going to edit this into this file

This is Calvin Kang, and would like to learn FinTech knowledge skills and try to explore my interest and ability to be marketable in Syd.

Currently, I cannot see myself in five year time because I still dont find my ture desire of career path and I figure why dont start with my both qualifications, namely IT and Finance, hence the effort of learning FinTech.

The main area of FinTech I would like to throw myself in is the Data analysis with machine learning, and hopefully I can build my own tradebot with my own algorithm, specifically in the area of stockmarket, and of course, I would like to get a bit test of gambling on things like scoccer game or others.
